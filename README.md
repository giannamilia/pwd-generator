# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

I created an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
